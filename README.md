Hi, I’m Elizabeth Stroud
I’m an archaeologist interested in using R for interrogating archaeological data, in particular isotopic and archaeobotanical data.
You can reach me at elizabeth.stroud@arch.ox.ac.uk. 

I have recently been developing the R packages WeedEco and CropPro which can be found at https://github.com/WeedEco and https://github.com/CropPro-package
